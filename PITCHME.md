Note:
Last time, we built this circuit using a breadboard. This time we will be building a more permanent device using protoboards
---
#### Arduinos for prototyping
#### Bare ICs for production
---
### Protoboards
Perfboard | Stripboard | Hybrids

Note:
For small or one-off projects, these universal boards are great, but for multiple copies of the final product, PCBs are better (very cheap)
